# Player C#
## Summary
 This project is a test of the tools that the [visual studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/) offers us to do `forms with .NET frameworks` using C# language creating veary easy a frame, components and also variables and events to asociate with the component. Also the possibility to customize all the components on the main frame.

 I made an example of a player like the music one with a counter, a button to play or stop and a circle that will grow as the counter goes up. I created a component with this frame and also add a combox to adjust the velocity of the counter grow. This program could be upgraded with an implementation of songs that could be played asociated with the counter and the play button.
